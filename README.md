This is an implemenatation of three polynomial basis surrogate models, namely:

- full polynomial chaos expansions

- sparse polynomials chaos expansions according to

Blatman, G. and B. Sudret (2011). 
Adaptive sparse polynomial chaos expansion based on least-angle regression.
Journal of Computational Physics 230(6), 2345 - 2367.  

- continuous-space low-rank approximations in canonical polyadics format according to

Konakli, K. and B. Sudret (2016b). 
Polynomial meta-models with canonical low-rank approximations:

Journal of Computational Physics 321, 1144 - 1169.

Moreover, an implementation of variance-based sensitivity analysis tools based on the model coefficients should follow which is according to
